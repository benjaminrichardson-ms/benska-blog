One of the essential components of our Prius camper setup is our Pure Sine Wave inverter that can supply up to 600 watts of continuous power or 1,200 watts of burst power. The inverter is connected to the 12-volt battery of the car, and by keeping the car in the on 'Ready' position, the Prius will periodically run the motor to charge up the 12v battery to prevent over-discharge.

The main reason we have the inverter is to power our laptops as we are working during the day. In the evening we can also put on the internal lights when needed, or because we are travelling in winter, the heater for several minutes when needed.

For the majority of the time though, we are just powering my Macbook Pro, and Ska's MSI laptop. They draw about 70 watts, and 100 watts respectively. We also need to factor in the approximately 10 watts that the inverter will draw just by being switched on. This gives us a load of around 180 watts for this test.

When we are using the inverter, most importantly, the car must be switched on so the Prius can replenish the batteries via the motor when they are getting low. The Prius will run the motor for several seconds when first switched on, then the motor will shut off. It will stay off until the batteries are getting low and the motor is needed to generate more electricity.

In our case, the car will turn on for about 30 seconds every 25 to 30 minutes. When the motor turns on, it is only idling hence it is very quiet. Combined with the shortness of run time, I have confidence that we can be close to other campers without annoying them which is a big plus.

Because the car is on, it is wise to turn off any accessories in the car that are using power that you don't need right at that moment. Usually, this means turning off the headlights, turning off the fan to prevent any heating or cooling, make sure any internal car lights are in the off position, and turn off the radio system.

To measure our fuel usage as a result of running the inverter, we set up a test where we could monitor the L/100KM value, over the number of KM we had driven. At the beginning of our test, the values were 29.6KM travelled, at an efficiency of 7.6L/100KM (I had just driven up into the mountains to get a fuel efficiency this bad, but we are just looking at the difference, not the starting value). At 4:15 pm we turned on the inverter, plugged in the laptops and got to work. At about 10 pm, our efficiency had been reduced to 9.9L/100KM.

To work out the usage, we need to look at the efficiency decrease, then adjust that for the 29.6KM we had on the odometer. Doing the maths, this comes in at a difference of 2.3L/100KM. Because this value is over 100KM, we need to adjust it appropriately. This comes out as 2.3 / 100 * 29.6, or 0.681, or ~680mL of fuel for the afternoon/evening.

The next day we did the same thing, starting in the morning and keeping the car/inverter on with a load of a couple of laptops plus a few other bits and pieces. By the end of the second day, our efficiency had gone to 17.5L/100KM. Doing the same maths as before, it is a difference of 9.9 / 100 * 29.6 being 2.93 or 2,930mL of fuel.

We had filled up at 112.9c/L at our last fuel stop, so we used $3.31 of fuel for the 1.5 days (12 hour days of using power) of running the car for power.

For a comparison compared to a petrol generator, I will have to make a close but not 100% accurate comparison. On the Bunnings website, I found a 1000 watt generator that can run for 9.7 hours on its 7L tank (with a 50% max load). Given there is no battery on the generator, while it is running it can only put power into the laptops. I think it would be fair to say we could run the generator for 45 mins to run the laptops for 1.5 hours. Using the same amount of fuel we could run the generator for about 4 hours on 2.93L of fuel. This would give us 5.3 cycles of 45 mins charge to 1.5 hours on the laptop batteries. This is about 12 hours of continuous usage with a generator, compared to the 18 hours we get with the car system.

It is not too far off the efficiency we get with the car, but it is a lot more hassle. With a generator, you would have to continuously monitor it, and turn it on and off. You need to bring it separately, as well as bringing separate fuel. Not a super portable solution, and it is a lot noisier so not great for camping.

Just noting, in my fictional generator numbers above there is a 50% greater efficiency of the car over the generator, but I have no idea how the load affects the generator fuel usage. My 50% number is just from the website and assuming this is for 500 watts being the minimum the generator can output while running.

Having done this test now, we have a lot more certainty around how long we can run our setup before we need to go and get fuel. In most cases, we always have plenty of fuel. But if I need to decide whether I need to do a special trip just to refuel, I can make a much more informed choice about the potential remaining fuel and planned usage. The days we did this test, had I already known this we could have avoided the 60KM round trip down the mountain and back up again as we would have known the quarter tank we had was enough. The other great bit of learning out of this is the accuracy of fuel consumption, even when the car is stationary for multiple days. It is still counted and reflected in the efficiency measurement, and average speed.
