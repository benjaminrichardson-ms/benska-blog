Our next destination is Clairview. We found out about this town from a billboard on the road advertising for BarraCrab Caravan Park.

When we arrived, they looked packed. We just remembered that today is a public holiday here. Jam's friend and staff from Hervey Bay told us before. Luckily, we managed to get the last slot available for an unpowered site because we are in a car. We settled ourselves under a tree to ensure we have a good shade in the day while we are working.

Around 5 pm, we went for a walk to the beach to see the water. It looks close enough. However, we were wrong. The water was probably at least 750m away from the beginning of the beach. We then learnt that this area must be under the water when the tide rises.

It was such an exciting experience. The water was slowly flowing in instead of what we normally see, waves crashing in and pulling out.

After that, we went to wash our feet in the main amenities area. Jam then received an SMS from BarraCrab, informing the happy hours and dinner menu for the night: $10 for steak or minced beef burger, $5 for a sausage sizzle, and $3 chips. Meal for tonight is settled!
