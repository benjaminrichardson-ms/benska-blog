For the first town, we decided to go to Cowra. Our original plan was to go to Central Coast. However, due to the increase of COVID case in Greater Sydney, we think it's better to drive far from that area.

I know we've said we've learnt not to arrive to late but we still did. This time, we made a call before hand to let them know we will arrive after 6. As we were registering ourselves, guess what we saw? As the title suggest, it's this fluffy cutie!

What an awesome way to start this trip!
