It’s Friday and we are both not working today. We already packed half of our stuff the previous night and are taking our own sweet time now. We double checked our packing list. Clothing, toiletries, tech, power, entertainment, sleeping, cooking, washing, food and water; all checked.

It’s already past two and we were finally ready to leave. We left home feeling excited and anxious. Did we leave anything important? Hopefully anything that we can buy anything that we forgot.

Today destination is Griffith. I was thinking of going to Wagga Wagga just to get Mates Gully wood-fired pizza. However, they were still closed due to government restriction.

We arrived at Griffith around 530pm. We drove along the city centre up to the TAFE and turned around to find a parking slot. There seems to be many Italian restaurant here. Later we learnt that Griffith has Italian history. Anyway, the first two restaurant we went to seems to be at capacity. We then went to Il Corso Cafe. They had table for two outside.

We ordered bolognese pizza and pork belly. OMG, the pork belly was amazing. It was such a generous portion for an entree. Totally a must try!

After dinner, we went to look for caravan park. By then, all of the caravan parks are already closed. The first time we went to a caravan park sometime last year, the park allow us to pick a space and pay in the morning. We didn’t know that wasn’t the norm. Now we’ve learnt our first lesson. Always go to caravan park first when you arrive in a town and aim to arrive early.

Luckily, the third park that we went to allow us to stay. They told us the kitchen is already closed but we really just need to place to spend the night. We parked under a tree and quickly set up our bed. The weather forecast said high chance of rain in the morning. Hopefully we can wake up before it rained.
