On our way to Goondiwindi, we planned to go to two tracks at Mount Kaputar National Park: Sawn Rocks and Waa Gorge. 

Sawn Rocks track is wheelchair accessible. It is also pretty short, it only took us around 10 mins to reach the rock formation.

The Sawn Rocks is fascinating. This rock formation is called 'organ-piping'. Well, they do look like a wall of organ pipes, don't they? They stand 40m high from the creek and is the remains of a basalt lava flow from Nandewar Volcano from 21 million years ago. The Volcano now is extinct.  There are two types of the rock shape, one with five sides and the other with 6 sides. Seems like most that we saw were six-sided. They are formed due to cooling process of basalt, which happen from outside toward the centre, causing shrinkage cracks to form.

After admiring all the cool rocks, we drove to Waa Gorge.

Seeing the two options by Google Map, Jam chose the longer route which he thought would be more scenic. It was indeed more scenic and only 10 minutes longer. However, now I can tell you, if you are driving a Prius, don't go by this side. It was doable but there were lots of gravel road and rocks on the road. At one point, we stopped, get out of the car and walked further to see whether our Prius could handle it and nah, it wasn't possible. If you do choose this route, on the map where I circled and it says turn left, go straight instead. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/eqG3P4E8kba4mtcB8) is the adjusted direction for Prius.
