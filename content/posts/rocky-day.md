On our way to Goondiwindi, we planned to go to two tracks at Mount Kaputar National Park: Sawn Rocks and Waa Gorge. 

Sawn Rocks track is wheelchair accessible. It is also pretty short, it only took us around 10 mins to reach the rock formation.

The Sawn Rocks is fascinating. This rock formation is called 'organ-piping'. Well, they do look like a wall of organ pipes, don't they? They stand 40m high from the creek and is the remains of a basalt lava flow from Nandewar Volcano from 21 million years ago. The Volcano now is extinct.  There are two types of the rock shape, one with five sides and the other with 6 sides. Seems like most that we saw were six-sided. They are formed due to cooling process of basalt, which happen from outside toward the centre, causing shrinkage cracks to form.

After admiring all the cool rocks, we drove to Waa Gorge.

Seeing the two options by Google Map, Jam chose the longer route which he thought would be more scenic. It was indeed more scenic and only 10 minutes longer. However, now I can tell you, if you are driving a Prius, don't go by this side. It was doable but there were lots of gravel road and rocks on the road. It was more suited for a 4WD. At one point, we stopped, get out of the car and walked further to see whether our Prius could handle it and nah, it wasn't possible. If you do choose this route, on the map where I circled and it says turn left, go straight instead. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/eqG3P4E8kba4mtcB8) is the adjusted direction for Prius. Also, it ended up taking around 2 hours due to the road conditions.

As we drove, we were greeted by a herd of cows chilling on the road. Seems like most this drive is in people's farms. Later on, nearer to the Waa Gorge, we were welcomed by a series of gates to keep the animal stock in. If you are driving with other people, that'll be better cause the other person can open the gate, you drive through, then the other person close it. Otherwise, you need to keep walking back and forth between the gate and your car. In total, there were 6 gates.

Today feels very adventurous to us because of the route that we took. Seems like that's enough adventure for the day. As we drove to Goondiwindi, we stopped by McDonald's at Moree at get ourselves dinner from the drive-thru.

Into Goondiwindi, we were greeted by border control. We already filled in the border declaration pass few days before and also printed them to display on passenger-side dashboard. The agent asked us some questions and everything was done in just few minutes. It was very efficient.
