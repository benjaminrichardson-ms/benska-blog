On our way to Goondiwindi, we planned to go to two tracks at Mount Kaputar National Park: Sawn Rocks and Waa Gorge. 

Sawn Rocks track is wheelchair accessible. It is also pretty short that it only took us around 10 mins to reach the rock formation.

The Sawn Rocks is fascinating. This rock formation is called 'organ-piping'. Well, they do look like a wall of organ pipes, don't they? They stand 40m high from the creek and is the remains of basalt lava flow from Nandewar Volcano from 21 million years ago. The Volcano now is extinct. There are two types of rock shape, one with five sides and the other with six sides. It seems like most that we saw was six-sided. They are formed due to the cooling process of basalt, which happens from outside toward the centre, causing shrinkage cracks to form.

After admiring all the cool rocks, we drove to Waa Gorge.

Seeing the two options by Google Map, Jam chose the longer route, which he thought would be more scenic. It was indeed more scenic and only 10 minutes longer. However, now I can tell you, if you are driving a Prius, don't go by this side. It was doable, but there were lots of gravel road and rocks on the way. It was more suited for a 4WD. At one point, we stopped, get out of the car and walked further to see whether our Prius could handle it and Nah, it wasn't possible. If you do choose this route, on the map where I circled, and it says turn left, go straight instead. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/eqG3P4E8kba4mtcB8) is the adjusted direction for Prius. Also, it ended up taking around 2 hours due to the road conditions.

As we drove, a herd of cows chilling on the road blocked our way It seems like most this drive is in people's farms. Nearer to the Waa Gorge, we were welcomed by a series of gates to keep the animal stock in. If you are driving with other people, that will be good. The other person can open the gate, you drive through, then they close it. Otherwise, you would end up keep walking back and forth between the gate and your car. In total, there were six gates.

Today feels very adventurous to us because of the route that we took. That's enough adventure for the day. As we drove to Goondiwindi, we stopped by McDonald's at Moree to get ourselves dinner from the drive-thru.

Into Goondiwindi, we were greeted by border control. We already filled in the border declaration pass few days before and also printed them to display on the passenger-side dashboard. The agent asked us some questions, and everything was done in just a few minutes. It was very efficient.
