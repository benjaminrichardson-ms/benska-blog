This will be the first time we are going to Great Barrier Reef so we are pretty excited. We booked the resort in Fitzroy Island for a night. One thing that we didn't realise until the day before we reached Cairns was that we need to find a car park for our car.

I tried googling for some information and seems like we would need to pay at least $35. The Pier is charging between $35-$40 based on their [website](https://thepiercairns.com.au/general-info/). I called Hilton too and they also said it would cost at least $40. That's a lot!

Once we arrived in Cairns, we decided to go to a visitor centre to ask for advice on overnight parking. Anyway, we also just found out that the visitor centres in Cairns are not like those in smaller towns. They are more like tour agencies. So, we went to this guy for advice, and he told us a few places where we can park. 

One is the parking in the centre median in the CBD. He said most of the backpackers would park there. However, the one with[ 8P free parking](https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/water-waste-roads/parking/on-street-parking) is pretty far from the pier. We are also not comfortable with leaving our car for a day in the busy street. Another one would be the $3 parking per entry at [Convention Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/GruoeqBzB1mA2ojp6). This one is amazing!
