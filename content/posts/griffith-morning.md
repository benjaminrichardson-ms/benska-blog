We woke up to a drizzle around 7 am. Luckily, we are parked under a tree so we didn't get too wet as we got ready for the day. We had leftover pizza and brioche for breakfast.

\[BOOKLET]

As we looking for things to see at Griffith, we saw Hermit's Cave on the map. Seems interesting.

When we arrived at Hermit's Cave, the wind was pretty strong up there for otherwise a warm day. There is a good view of the fields from there. We then walked down to look at the actual cave and the chapel. When we turned towards the road to the chapel, guess what we found?

Between these two giant rocks, on a small path, there was a pile of shit. We would have thought it was some random animal's shit if not for another pile of toilet paper beside it. With so many bush around, I wonder why the person decided to do it on a path. Maybe the rocks made them feel more secure.

We decided to turn back and look at the cave and kitchen instead. The place has a really good view. It faces southeast, so I guessed it gets morning sun. I wonder how cold is it to live there.

After looking around and reading some description, we then decided to go to a winery nearby since \[REGION] is said to be the \[TOP WINE DISTRIBUTOR?] in Australia.

We arrived at Yarran Wines around 10 am. It looked so quiet so we were not sure if they are actually open since most stores are still not fully operating due to government restriction. We walked in and asked whether they are doing wine tasting. Luckily, they said they have 30 mins before the first group come and they can slot us in for a quick tasting. We checked how many drinks would let us stay under the limit. Since I do not like red wine anyway, I decided to only try 3 of the white wines and let Jam had his full experience. Well, technically, since we didn't book in, we also had the short version of the wine tasting.

Previously, I saw some fun facts about Durif in the booklet and a sign on the road saying something about Cuvée. Now we've learnt that both of them are actually wine grape. According to the staff at Yarran Wines, in France, Cuvée is usually used to mix with other grape. However, they made a whole wine out of Cuvée.

We ended up buying 4 wines. I wonder if we would end up drinking everything before we get home.
