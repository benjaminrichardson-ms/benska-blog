Marlborough is a one-hour drive away from Rockhampton. It is a small town with 149 people, according to [2016 census](https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC31783). What a luck! On our way there, a tiny rock hit our windscreen as a truck drove past. We wouldn't be able to claim insurance too since it will cost below the excess. Since we are not sure whether this would happen again to us, we might keep the windscreen as it is until we are back in Canberra. Hopefully, it won't get bigger.

After we arrive in Marlborough, we drove around the town, which took only less than 5 minutes probably. There is a museum in town, but we didn't visit it since today is a busy day for both of us. We then went to the caravan park. They have a cat here too! The cat is shy though. I only managed to give a few pets before they walked away.

After we registered, we got ourselves a spot under a big tree. Parking under a tree is always good because it provides shade. However, there are also more chances of bird poo falling. This was proven not long after. We found bird poo on the wooden cover on one of the boxes. We then moved our car and boxes slightly out of the tree but still under the shades. It seems like it's going to be car wash day again soon.
