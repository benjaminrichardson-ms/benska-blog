We arrived in Rockhampton pretty early. I guessed living outdoor has made us sleep and wake up earlier. I hope this habit will continue when we come back home.

The first caravan park we went to doesn't have an unpowered site, so we would need to pay for a powered site which costs $38. We checked out their camp kitchen, and it was more of a BBQ area and nothing much. We then decided to go to a bigger caravan park which is Discovery Park. Since we are busy with planning meetings today, we prefer a place with a decent camp kitchen where we can work.

The camp kitchen in this park is pretty big. There are two different kitchens in the same building, so there can be two people cooking at the same time. I thought maybe we should have BBQ dinner. This would be the first time we are having a BBQ throughout all of our trips.

It seems like we are meant to do this. Around 5 pm, another couple came over and cooked BBQ. The smell was amazing. It's making the craving stronger. We then went to Woolies and guess what we found? Rump steak on half price! 1 kg for $12. Yay!
